<h3><strong>Will LegalTech replace lawyers?</strong></h3>
<p><em>Insight MinLaw goes behind the scenes to uncover stories about how the work we do impacts you.</em> 
<br>
</p>
<p>On 19 July 2022, MinLaw launched the Legal Tech Platform Initiative (LTPI),
to support Singapore law firms to reinvigorate their digitalisation journey
(Watch the highlights <a href="https://youtu.be/Etwv6e1utgg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>The initiative comprises (a) the Legal Technology Platform (LTP), a matter
management and collaboration tool, (b) the LTPI funding programme, as well
as (c) industry engagement initiatives.</p>

<p>Designed to streamline legal workflows, the LTP includes key features
such as a legal project management toolkit, customisable matter templates,
as well as integration with select practice management systems (“PMS”),
document management systems (“DMS”), communications tool such as WhatsApp,
and other commonly used legaltech tools.</p>
<p>The team identified features that will be most useful to Singapore lawyers,
such as integration with WhatsApp and data localization, through extensive
consultation with the legal industry.</p>

<p>Insight MinLaw caught up with Chief Commercial Officer and Co-Founder
of Lupl, Matthew Pollins as well as Director at MinLaw (Professional Services
Programme Office) Alyssa Toh, to share more on what went behind the building
of the LTP and other aspects of the LTPI.</p>

<p><strong><em>Insight MinLaw: What are some of the biggest challenges and trends you have noticed in LegalTech, locally and globally?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Matt: The big trend right now is integration. There is a growing amount
of LegalTech out there but too often, those tools and systems do not integrate
well with each other. That was one of the biggest frustrations we noted
from law firms and legal departments all over the world, including in Singapore.
That is why we are so excited about the LTPI, because it is all about bringing
things together in a simple and intuitive system, with a combination of
rich native functionality and integrations with key systems.</p>
<p>Alyssa: In our engagements with the industry, many lawyers highlighted
a range of challenges that cause inefficiencies in their daily workflows.
These include having to toggle among various communication mediums like
messaging applications, emails, and Microsoft Teams with clients, because
it requires additional effort to track and document essential information
for cases. Lawyers also struggle to consistently track down the amount
of work and level of profitability for each client’s case in real time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there are many tools available in the market, most tools are designed
for discrete functions and do not allow lawyers to have a single, consolidated
view of their matters. In addition, Small and Medium Practices (SMPs) may
not be resourced from a cost and expertise point of view, to be able to
effectively curate suitable solutions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Insight MinLaw: What was the impetus and the factors considered behind the development of LTP?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Alyssa: The LTP is conceptualised with lawyers and law firms in mind and
meant to address their pain points, and targeted to directly help SMPs.
It is designed around lawyers’ typical matter workflows so that it is intuitive
to use. As a cloud/browser-based solution, it minimises the need for law
firms to set up specialised IT expertise to manage the firm’s technology
suite.</p>
<p>At the same time, we made sure that the LTP is integrated with other commonly
used legaltech tools, to ensure that it caters to the needs of legal firms
at various stages of digitalisation. Law firms which are just starting
their digitalisation journey can easily choose and onboard a comprehensive
suite of technology tools which are already widely accepted by the market.
The inter-operability with existing legaltech tools also makes it easier
for law firms with existing solutions to come onboard seamlessly.</p>
<p>Matt: We spent several months just listening to lawyers at Singapore law
firms, working closely with MinLaw and consulting with key industry groups
in Law Society and others. We wanted to make sure we had a deeper understanding
of their workflows, current technology systems, and the key challenges.
That input directly shaped the features for the LTP.</p>
<p>For example, we heard a lot from lawyers about the importance of data
protection, and how data localisation will provide additional comfort,
that is why the LTP is hosted in Singapore. Similarly, every lawyer we
spoke to mentioned that their clients increasingly tend to communicate
with them via WhatsApp – more so than in any other jurisdiction we have
come across.</p>
<p>For that reason, we built a WhatsApp integration, which allows lawyers
to meet clients where they are, without sacrificing security and compliance.
This iterative development process is never complete – it is a constant
progress. Currently, we are experiencing a high demand for more connectivity
with Government and public data systems, such as &nbsp;eLitigation, and
this is next on our development roadmap.</p>

<p><strong><em>Insight MinLaw: Why launch the initiative now?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Alyssa: Digitalisation has been a multi-year effort for MinLaw. Since
2017, MinLaw has embarked on various efforts to encourage digitalisation,
particularly among the SMPs. Most of the earlier initiatives were targeted
at extending grants that subsidised the costs of onboarding selected digital
solutions.</p>
<p>However, the pain points experienced by law firms during technology adoption
go beyond the dollars and cents. A key challenge lies in the lack of the
economies-of-scale to effectively identify, curate, and deploy technology
solutions. This calls for a more direct form of support by providing the
actual solutions that can address the digitalisation challenges faced by
the industry.</p>
<p>The timing is right for a more direct support like the LTP, because the
COVID-19 pandemic has renewed the industry’s interest and appetite in technology
adoption. During the Circuit Breaker period, many SMPs found it challenging
to continue with their business operations as they lacked the digital means
to transit fully into remote working. With this experience in mind, SMPs
have become more open to adopting legal technology.</p>
<p><strong><em>Insight MinLaw: What do you think differentiates the LTP from other LegalTech platforms?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Alyssa: I think what sets the LTP apart is the co-creation approach MinLaw
has taken to develop the LTP. It is a continual process which involves
an established active feedback loop with the legal community, to test and
provide their insights and suggestions to refine the platform.</p>
<p>It was through this process that we identified important Singapore-specific
features, such as the WhatsApp integration I mentioned earlier, and have
comments consolidated on the LTP. As far as we know, such an integration
is an industry-first, because we heard our lawyers say that WhatsApp is
a mode of communication that clients here commonly use.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we will build more Singapore-specific features, such as
linkages to public systems including eLitigation– which will be made available
later. The enhanced access allows lawyers to be more efficient in using
these systems. Such integrations are possible only with the strong support
of the Government and public institutions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Insight MinLaw: What was your experience like collaborating with MinLaw? Was there a eureka moment? Tell us what went on behind the scenes.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Matt: I remember reading MinLaw’s Technology and Innovation Roadmap back
in late 2020, thinking how unique it was for the public sector to be getting
behind legal technology for the benefit of law firms and their clients.
It is the only country I can think of where such support and backing exists.</p>
<p>Of course, a roadmap is one thing – delivering on it is another – and
there has been a huge amount of hard work in the background over several
months, from MinLaw, Lupl, various industry groups and our integration
partner companies such as Tessaract, Clio, LexisNexis, iManage, Net Documents
and others.</p>
<p><strong><em>Insight MinLaw: Tell us more about the funding programme and other ways in which MinLaw is supporting law firms’ onboarding to the LTP?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Alyssa: Cost is an important consideration for law firms when it comes
to digital adoption. For the LTP, we partnered with Infocomm Media Development
Authority and Enterprise SG to roll out a funding programme where law firms
can obtain substantial support, up to 70% for up to two years. This will
help them significantly in lowering the initial costs of adoption.</p>
<p>Apart from funding, our technology provider, Lupl, has also provided a
dedicated onboarding and customer success team to guide the law firms adopting
the solution. There is also 24/7 tech support to address issues timely.
All these go towards ensuring a smooth and seamless onboarding process
to the LTP for law firms.</p>

<p><strong><em>Insight MinLaw: What future developments can we look forward to in terms of the LTP? And what is the vision for the LTPI?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Matt: We have come a long way in a short period of time. But we are not
done! Our commitment to Singapore firms is that we will keep listening
and keep responding. Some of the areas we are prioritising right now include
linking up with Government and public systems, like SingPass. We have also
heard some requests for integrations or features to help streamline Know
Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering software. That is something we
are also actively exploring.</p>
<p>Finally, we continue to add depth and breadth to the native features of
the platform itself. One of our most popular features is Matter Templates
– think of these as pre-built matters that help automate matter setup,
accelerate the process, and reduce risks. We are looking to add more Singapore-specific
content to the library, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Most importantly, our message to Singapore law firms is – to keep the
ideas coming! The LTP exists to help make things easier and efficient for
the benefit of you and your clients – and this is your opportunity to tell
us what you would like to see. Your ideas will shape the future of the
LTP.</p>
<p>Alyssa: We hope that availing an easy to use, low-cost, “one-stop solution”
that could fulfil most of the law firms’ digitalisation needs will accelerate
the digitalisation journeys of the Singapore law firms. At the firm-level,
law firms can benefit from productivity gains and operational resilience.
At the industry level, it brings us closer to our ambitions of modernising
the Singapore legal sector and spurring more legal technology innovation
here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Insight MinLaw: Do you think there will come a day when lawyers are replaced by technology? Why?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Alyssa: The short answer is no, at least not in our lifetime.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of room to leverage technology for the more standardised
and repetitive work, such as drafting legal letters, billing and accounting.
According to a report by Deloitte, 39% of legal jobs can be automated.
For complex work though, such as a multi-billion-dollar Mergers &amp; Acquisitions
transaction, or in mediation and arbitration, which requires a high level
of reasoning, creativity, and emotional intelligence, chances are that
people would still be more comfortable with their trusted legal professionals.</p>
<p>We should see technology as augmenting and enhancing what our lawyers
have to offer, because what it does is it enables our lawyers to improve
the quality of their work, free them up to do higher value-add work and
service their clients better.</p>
<p>So really, what technology does is it not only does not replace lawyers’
work, but in fact reduces laborious and repetitive manual work which are
less meaningful to them, so that they don’t waste their time and suffer
from burn-out.</p>
