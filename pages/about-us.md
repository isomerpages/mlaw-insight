## Uncover the Stories Inside MinLaw

We aim to demystify legal speak to ensure that Singapore’s legal framework is clear and transparent to all.

In line with our vision, “A trusted legal system, a trusted Singapore”, MinLaw believes that keeping the legal industry and community abreast with latest trends and developments, as well as staying relevant, upholds a strong foundation for an evolving Singapore.

## What We Do:

The Ministry of Law plays the following key roles:

* To formulate and review legal, intellectual property, land, insolvency, public trustee, moneylending, pawnbroking, legal aid and community mediation policies, as well as legislation and strategies under MinLaw's purview;

* To provide legal and policy input for other Ministries' proposed Bills and programmes; and

* To develop the legal services, alternative dispute resolution and intellectual property sectors.

* To regulate and license all law practice entities and register foreign-qualified lawyers in Singapore.

The Ministry of Law also comprises these Statutory Boards and Agency:
